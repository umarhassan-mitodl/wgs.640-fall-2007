## Reading Guidelines

- Read strategically: we've given you the ideal, in-depth list that really covers an individual issue.
- Don't start on page 1 and read through page by page. Look through the books and find what's interesting to you, what you can connect to other things that you're reading.
- Make sure you're on top of the reading in terms of knowing contours and have really dug down and focused on a couple of places in the reading assignment.
- Come to class prepared to discuss the readings.

## Discussion Leaders

- Figure out the trajectory you'd think would work well for class.
- Write out questions.
- When you come to class, you want to be able to give everyone a sense of the background, how the readings fit together.
- Take notes to get a full sense of what happens during the discussion.
    - Email a brief paper to the rest of the class summarizing what happened.
    - If we read your summary paper two days before class as well as doing homework one day before class, we should come to class with a very strong sense of where we are and where we're going.
- Use whatever style works well for you and can get others interested in discussing the readings.
    - For example, specify pages in books.
    - Use bullet points and ask questions.
        - Your questions just can't be rhetorical; they should be about something you find interesting or strange.
        - Do not write a long paper to read in classâ€”that doesn't spark discussion.
- One of the professors is associated with each reading; ask them if you have questions.
